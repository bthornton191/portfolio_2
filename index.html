                        We investigate here effects of adaptations like dimension reduction, omission of parameter correlation, and grid
                        refinement on parameter influence over material temperature response and total recession. The task is accomplished by
                        applying Morris screening and method of Sobol' sensitivity studies applied to a range of 3-D, 1-D, and 1-D TC1-driver
                        cases for the MSL entry through the Martian atmosphere, where the material response of the MSL heat shield is simulated
                        with NASA's PATO toolbox. Results of the investigation show that lower-dimensional approaches can, in some cases, be
                        utilized for initial parameter screening prior to execution of a fully-detailed simulation, but in general, obtained
                        sensitivities differ. Moreover, coarse computational grids do not impose significantly distinct input-output mechanics
                        and can be utilized for accurate screening and quantitative sensitivity analysis exercises even with non-negligible
                        residual values. The investigation also discusses the implications of an unknown correlation structure on parameter
                        sensitivities while finding little evidence of significant correlation effects on parameter classification given input

                        PPy-based membranes exchange ions with electrolyte through reversible redox processes and hence are best suited as
                        electrodes for batteries and super capacitors. The energy density of batteries and super capacitors are dependent on the
                        specific capacitance of the conducting polymer and can be represented through a mechanistic model for ion transport.
                        Through this model, the specific capacitance of polypyrrole-based membranes is shown to be dependent on the number of
                        accessible redox sites at the electrolyte-polymer interface. The accessibility of redox sites at the electrolyte-polymer
                        interface can be increased by controlling the morphological properties and distribution of dopant in the polymer
                        backbone. Thus, by nanostructuring and by controlling the distribution of the dopant in the polymer, we have shown that
                        the capacitance of PPy-based membranes can be increased to 490 F.g−1 for a 50 mV.sec−1 scan rate and 0.6 g.cm−2 specific
                        mass. Despite this value of specific capacitance being the highest reported for PPy-based membranes to date, it is
                        estimated that only 69% of active redox sites are used for ion storage and hence can be increased further. Maximizing
                        specific capacitance requires an understanding of spatial distribution of redox sites in the polymer backbone and its
                        corresponding chemoelectrical activity. In order to generate a spatial map of ion storage in PPy-based membranes, this
                        article presents for the first time a shear-force (SF) based topography imaging and scanning electrochemical microscopy
                        (SECM) imaging of the PPy(DBS) under reduced and oxidized conditions. From a correlated topography and chemoelectrical
                        activity of PPy-based membrane, the data shows the availability of redox sites in the polymer and it is projected that
                        this result will enhance the design and nanostructuring of PPy-based membranes and distribution of dopant in the
                        backbone.

                        Flight data obtained using the instrumented heatshields on the Mars Science Laboratory and Mars 2020 has offered unique
                        validation data for material response and aerothermal environment modeling of Mars atmospheric entry. While the
                        environment and material response are coupled in reality, they are usually solved separately with a correction to
                        account for blowing at the surface. The objective of this work is to showcase the coupling of gas blowing between the

                        The open-source Porous Microstructure Analysis (PuMA) software was implemented to offer an efficient framework for
                        determining material characteristics from 3D microstructures. Its development was inspired by progress in X-ray
                        microtomography, an imaging technology that captures the internal structure of materials in 3D, and even in a 4D
                        temporal context. Over recent years, this method has transformed the domain of materials science due to its capability
                        to non-destructively examine material microstructures while presenting digital data about their geometrical details. It
                        has provided insights into materials relevant to several NASA missions, including heatshields, parachute fabrics,
                        meteorites, and other advanced composites.
                        
                        PuMA, in its current version 3, delivers an array of features, spanning from basic geometric insights of a
                        microstructure to intricate anisotropic thermo-elastic and chemical behavior. Specifically, the software evaluates
                        morphological attributes (specific surface area, volume fractions, mean intercept lengths, orientation) and physical
                        characteristics (conductivity, elasticity, permeability, and tortuosity). Additionally, it can model material
                        degradation processes, such as oxidation and surface chemistry interactions. The software can generate synthetic
                        microstructures, from straightforward geometrical designs to intricate woven and non-woven geometries. Coupling material
                        generation and characterization enable parametric studies and sensitivity analysis to optimize the microstructural
                        performance and inform design decisions and reliability assessment based on uncertainty quantification.
                        
                        A recent addition to PuMA includes the TomoSAM plugin, devised to incorporate the cutting-edge Segment Anything Model
                        (SAM). SAM is a promptable deep learning model that can identify objects and create image masks in a zero-shot manner,
                        based only on a few user clicks. The synergy between these tools aids in the segmentation of complex 3D datasets from
                        tomography or other imaging techniques, which would otherwise require a laborious manual segmentation process.

                        Instrumentation 2 (MEDLI2) suite that provided detailed in-flight data for the validation of aerothermodynamics models.
                        NuSil, a silicone overcoat that shows a protective effect against atomic oxygen, was applied as contamination control

                        The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) was protected during its atmospheric entry by an instrumented heat-shield using NASA's
                        Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) material. PICA is a lightweight carbon fiber/polymeric resin material that
                        offers out-standing performances for protecting probes during planetary entry. The Mars Entry Descent and Landing
                        Instrument (MEDLI) suite on MSL offers unique in-flight validation data for models of material response and atmospheric
                        entry. MEDLI recorded, among other things, time-resolved in-depth temperature data of PICA using thermocouple sensors
                        assembled in the MEDLI Integrated Sensor Plugs (MISP).
                        
                        The objective of this work is to showcase and analyze the coupling between the material response and the aerothermal
                        environment. As shown in Figure 1, the workflow is divided into the following steps. First, the aerothermal properties
                        are computed in the Data Parallel Line Relaxation (DPLR) code [3] and used with the Nonequilibrium air radiation
                        (NEQAIR) program [8] to compute radiative heating. Second, the thermal response inside the material is computed in the
                        Porous material Analysis Toolbox based on Open-FOAM (PATO) using a fixed blowing correction parameter. Third, the
                        pyrolysis gases computed in PATO are used as inputs to a blowing boundary condition within DPLR. Fourth, the new
                        environment properties from DPLR are used in NEQAIR to provide an updated solution, then both the updated aerothermal
                        environment and radiative heating are used in PATO without blowing correction. The third and fourth steps are then
                        repeated until convergence in surface temperature is obtained. Convergence in the radiative heating is generally
                        achieved before surface temperature, at which point the radiative heating is no longer updated. Char mass loss rates are
                        forced to zero to produce a non-receding surface condition.
                        
                        For early time points in the trajectory, where flow around the MSL aeroshell is rarefied, the Direct Simulation Monte
                        Carlo (DSMC) code, SPARTA, is used to compute the aerothermal environment. Iteration between PATO and SPARTA is not
                        performed due to the computational cost of DSMC simulations.
                        
                        Preliminary results of the coupling between PATO and DPLR for the MSL heatshield atmospheric entry model are presented
                        in Figures 2-4 at 65 seconds after entry interface. Figure 2 shows the surface temperature results from an uncoupled
                        simulation in PATO with the blowing correction parameter applied (left) along with the coupled surface temperature after
                        iteration (right). Figure 3 shows the surface temperature along the centerline from windward to leeward for easier
                        comparison. Figure 4 shows the coupled and uncoupled pyrolysis gas blowing rate.
                        
                        Mars 2020 used a similar heatshield consisting of PICA for thermal protection during entry, descent, and landing. In
                        preparation for Mars 2020 post-flight analysis, the predictive material response capability is benchmarked against
                        flight data from MEDLI. This work represents an important milestone toward the development of validated predictive
                        capabilities for designing thermal protection systems for planetary probes.

                        Imagine entering Earth’s atmosphere after returning from the outer solar system. A heat shield less than 2 inches thick
                        protects you from temperatures up to 2,900° Celsius (5,252° Fahrenheit). Such conditions were experienced by NASA’s
                        Stardust capsule during reentry in 2006. The only materials capable of providing the necessary protection are composites
                        with complex microstructures. Evaluating these materials is difficult, requiring precise knowledge of their properties.
                        To this end, NASA scientists are developing research codes to compute material properties and simulate ablation at the
                        microscale using agency supercomputers. Utilizing these tools, along with experiments, researchers are working to push

                        generation of material microstructures. From microstructural data, often obtained through X-ray microtomography, PuMA
                        can determine a number of effective material properties and perform material response simulations. Version 2.2 includes
                        capabilities for computing volume fractions, porosity, specific surface area, effective thermal and electrical
                        conductivities, and continuum and rarefied diffusive tortuosity. PuMA can also simulate competitive diffusion/reaction
                        processes at the micro-scale, such as surface oxidation. In this poster, recent advancements to the PuMA software are
                        detailed, including the full refactoring of PuMA into v3.0, a new module to compute heat conduction in anisotropic
                        materials, a particle method for simulating molecular beam experiments, a new finite-volume Laplace solver, complex
                        fibrous material generation, woven material generation, and a coupling of PuMA with the DAKOTA software for advanced
                        statistics.

                        The ablative materials used in thermal protection systems (TPS) undergo oxidation during atmospheric entry which leads
                        to an in-depth change in both permeability and porosity. These properties have a significant affect on heat transfer in
                        a TPS during entry. X-ray micro-tomography has provided 3D images capturing the micro-structure of TPS materials. In
                        this study, we use micro-tomography based simulations to create high-fidelity models relating permeability to porosity
                        during oxidation of FiberForm, the carbon fiber preform of the Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) often used as
                        a TPS material. The goal of this study is to inform full-scale models and reduce uncertainty in TPS modeling.
